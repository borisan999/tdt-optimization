feat: migrate to db-driven catalogs, implement dataset naming, and modernize dashboards
    2
    3 This commit represents a significant structural shift in how network configurations and optimizations are managed:
    4
    5 1. Centralized Equipment Catalogs & Parameters:
    6    - Migrated Derivadores and Repartidores from Excel-based to database-driven.
    7    - Seeded global system defaults for Building Geometry, Signal Constraints, and Attenuation.
    8    - Added a new administrative UI ('General Parameters') to manage these system defaults.
    9    - Refactored Excel processing to use database catalogs as the source of truth.
   10
   11 2. Dataset Naming & Identity:
   12    - Added 'dataset_name' to track configurations by descriptive labels (e.g., building names) instead of just IDs.
   13    - Integrated naming into manual entry, history dropdowns, and dashboard headers.
   14    - Updated all export filenames (Excel, CSV, DOCX) to include the sanitized dataset name.
   15
   16 3. Enforced 1:1 Optimization Relationship:
   17    - Modified logic to ensure each dataset configuration has exactly one authoritative optimization run.
   18    - Automatically clear previous results when re-running an optimization to maintain data integrity.
   19
   20 4. Modernized User Interface:
   21    - Upgraded Dataset Dashboard (view_dataset.php) to show structured canonical inputs and current result status.
   22    - Improved History view with Bootstrap 5 cards, color-coded status badges, and direct links to results.
   23    - Rendered equipment catalogs as user-friendly read-only tables during data entry.
   24    - Fixed UI issues including navigation tab highlighting and HTML structure.
   25
   26 5. Export Logic Decoupling:
   27    - Decoupled exports from database tables, ensuring they reflect the exact parameters stored in the optimization's 'inputs_json'.
