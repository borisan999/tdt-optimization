Please follow these steps in your **web browser's developer console** (not in my shell) after the `enter_data.php` page has fully loaded and the 'Piso Máximo' field visually displays '7':

1.  **Open the Browser's Developer Tools Console:**
    *   Right-click anywhere on the webpage and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element."
    *   In the window that appears, navigate to the "Console" tab.

2.  **Check the Live JavaScript Value of the Input Field:**
    *   In the Console, type the following command exactly as it appears (including quotes) and press Enter:
        ```javascript
        document.querySelector('[name="param_Piso_Maximo"]').value
        ```
    *   Please tell me the exact output you see (e.g., `"5"`, `"7"`, or something else).

3.  **Check for Dynamic JavaScript Changes (Optional but helpful):**
    *   Go to the "Elements" tab within the Developer Tools.
    *   Right-click on the 'Piso Máximo' input field in the displayed HTML structure (it should be an `<input>` tag with `name="param_Piso_Maximo"`).
    *   From the context menu, select "Break on..." and then "Attribute modifications" (or "Subtree modifications" if "Attribute modifications" is not an option).
    *   Now, reload the webpage (F5).
    *   Does the browser's debugger pause on any line of code? If so, this indicates that some JavaScript is actively changing the field. Please let me know if it pauses and, if possible, what code it pauses on.
