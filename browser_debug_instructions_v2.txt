Please perform these steps in your **web browser's developer console** (not in my shell) and tell me the results:

1.  **Ensure 'Manual Entry' tab is Active:** Make sure the "Manual Entry" tab on the webpage is currently selected and visible.

2.  **Check for Input Elements:**
    *   Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually by pressing `F12` or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect").
    *   Go to the "Console" tab.
    *   Type the following command and press Enter:
        ```javascript
        document.querySelectorAll('input[type="number"]')
        ```
    *   **What is the output?** (e.g., `NodeList(X) [input, input, ...]` or `NodeList []`). If it's a `NodeList` with elements, please expand it and confirm if an input with `name="param_Piso_Maximo"` is listed among them.

3.  **Re-check Specific Input Value (if elements are found):**
    *   If the previous command showed elements, then type this command and press Enter:
        ```javascript
        document.querySelector('[name="param_Piso_Maximo"]').value
        ```
    *   **What is the output?** (e.g., `"5"` or `"7"`).

Your previous feedback that the HTML `value` attribute was `5` but the box visually showed `7` is very unusual, suggesting a browser-specific rendering quirk or active JavaScript. Confirming the JavaScript `value` and element presence will help us narrow it down.
